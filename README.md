# Regression_Using_Manual_coding
This project is to implement Mini Batch Gradient Descent Regression by manually coding using Python

## It shows the internal working of Mini Batch Gradient descent regressor:
1. Cost function
2. Learning Rate
3. Finding the global minima of cost function by iterating through epochs and updating the cost function and returning the minimal cost.
5. If the cost function stops significantly decreasing for last 10 epochs we will break the loop and return the value.
